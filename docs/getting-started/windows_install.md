## Automatic installation

This method uses the package manager [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and will install everything you need, including required dependencies. Please note that this is a significant install process and takes time, but in the end all components will be ready for use. The installer assumes that these aren't installed already. If you do have some components (SuperCollider, SuperDirt, etc) it is recommended to use Manual install steps for the remaining components (see below).

Components installed via Chocolatey package manager:  
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.github.io/)
- [sc3-plugins](http://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins/)
- [msys2](https://www.msys2.org/) - (only needed for the choco install)
- [Haskell - ghc](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) & [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)
- [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt) with the [dirt sample library](https://github.com/musikinformatik/Dirt-Samples) and [Vowel quark](https://github.com/supercollider-quarks/Vowel)
- [Pulsar-dev Editor](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) with TidalCycles plugin package

### Installation procedure

Installation has 3 steps. You may get security pop-up windows for you to accept. Windows 7 users: please review the prep steps outlined at the end of this page.

**I - Starting powershell as administrator**
>    -   Windows 10 - Hold down the windows key
>        and press 'x', then choose Windows PowerShell (admin) in
>        the menu that pops up.
>    -   Windows 7 - Click the start button, type `powershell`, then
>        click with the right mouse button and choose **Run as
>       Administrator**.

**II - Installing Chocolatey: the package manager**

> The [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) package
> manager is required. If you haven't installed it previously, you can
> get it by running this command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

**III - Installing TidalCycles**

> Run the following command to install Tidal Cycles using Chocolatey:

```bash
choco install tidalcycles
```
**Note:** The full install will take 30 - 60 minutes. It is best to let it run to the end, but if it exits without completion or if you need to abort - you can try running this command again. Choco will skip over any package dependencies that are already complete.

After the powershell script is finished, you should review the choco install logs for any errors.  
`C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\logs\chocolatey.log`

**IV - Potential problems and fixes**

- *SuperCollider quarks install failed for SuperDirt, Dirt Samples, and/or Vowel.*  
These can be installed manually within the SuperCollider IDE. See the command to execute in the Manual installation section below.
- *Pulsar install failed.*  
Download the installer manually from [Pulsar-dev](pulsar-edit.dev). Once installed, follow the step below to install the TidalCycles plugin package.
- *Pulsar install succeeded but didn't install the TidalCycles plugin package.*  
This can done manually from within Pulsar. From the top menu, open the Package Manager, select Install search for TidalCycles, and select install.
- *Haskell (ghc) or cabal install fails.*  
You can try running the `choco install tidalcycles` command again or see the TidalCycles & Haskell steps below.

## Manual installation

This method is recommended for users who already have some of the components such as ([Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/), [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/downloads), [SuperDirt](https://github.com/musikinformatik/SuperDirt)). All these components are needed to install Tidal Cycles.

### SC3 Plugins

[SC3 Plugins](https://supercollider.github.io/sc3-plugins/) is needed if you want to use any of the synthesizers included with Tidal Cycles. Most of the examples in the documentation will still work, but your installation will likely be incomplete without it. You can skip the installation but be sure to come back later to install it if you want.

### SuperDirt

SuperDirt is the audio engine used by Tidal. Without it, Tidal Cycles will not emit any sound and will not be able to communicate through OSC or MIDI with other synthesizers. To install it, open SuperCollider and run the following command in the interactive editor (press Ctrl+Return to evaluate):

```c
Quarks.checkForUpdates({Quarks.install("SuperDirt", "v1.7.3"); thisProcess.recompile()})
```

The installation will take a little while. You will know when the installation process is done by looking at the logs window. It will likely print something like the following:

```c
Installing SuperDirt
Installing Vowel
Vowel installed
Installing Dirt-Samples
Dirt-Samples installed
SuperDirt installed
compiling class library...
...
(then some blah blah, and finally, something like:)
...

<!--T:28-->
*** Welcome to SuperCollider 3.12.1. *** For help press Ctrl-D.
```

### Tidal Cycles & Haskell

You will need [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/) (Ghcup) to install Tidal Cycles. If you just installed it or already had it installed, open `PowerShell` in **administrator mode** (see above). Enter the following commands:

```shell
cabal update
cabal v1-install tidal
```
Make sure to use `v1-install`, as `v2-install tidal` *may not work*.

The last command might take some time to complete. Be patient, and everything will be alright :smile:.

## Getting Help

If you are having trouble with installation, here are options:
- Review this page carefully and make sure you are following all instructions.  
- For individual component problems - such as SuperCollider and SuperDirt - check their ReadMe pages in GitHub.
- [TidalCycles Discord - Installation Help Channel](https://discord.com/channels/779427371270275082/779487905822801930)
    - Try searching this channel to see if your problem has been experienced by others
    - Be sure to post details - what exact problem, error messages, what Windows version, etc.
    - See the "how to ask" channel for more about getting help from our community
- Don't get discouraged! Tidal has a complex stack, but these components are all proven, robust and stable. Once it is all working, it rarely needs to have any attention.

## Note for Windows 7 users

If you are using Windows 7, some extra preparation is required before installing everything else:

1.  Make sure Windows 7 is up to date with the latest patches.
2.  Install/upgrade to .NET 4.5. You can [download it here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=30653).
3.  Install Visual C++ redistributable. You can [download it here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)

## I've installed Tidal Cycles. What's next?

Look at the sidebar. You will see a list of text editors you can install to interact with Tidal and start playing :smile:.
